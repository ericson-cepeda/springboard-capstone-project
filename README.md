# Springboard Capstone Project

Springboard Data Science Python

## Ideas

1. Correlation: weather and population by region, presented as a heat map. 
   * Historical data could provide insights of how, based on new data from sensors, the population will migrate.
   * Dataset: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/us-weather-history
   * Can it be complemented with air quality data? https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data
   * State of the art: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378016300140


2. Machine learning, text classification: From a data set of conversations b2c.
   * Discover what clients ask for in order to define FAQ's and conversational bots that can interact with them.
   * Dataset: Historical data provided by Twnel Inc.


3. Correlation: cryptocurrencies historical data.
   * When did Bitcoin become the currency that shows investors doing financial movements with other digital currencies?
   * AI could determine whether another currency could have the potential to replace Bitcoin as the main transactional indicator.
   * Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data
   * Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/jessevent/all-crypto-currencies

4. Recommendation: Prices from reviews
   * Prices can be guessed/suggested from a reviews dataset.
 Â  * A shoppers network can get benefits from the system being able to automate the process through AI, generating more revenue.
   * Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercari-price-suggestion-challenge/data
